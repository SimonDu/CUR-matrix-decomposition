% in is a structure with (at least) the following fields:

%
% chunk is the number of iterations after which to reorthogonalize and to check
% the leverage scores for convergence
%
% tol determines the tolerance for convergence: when the inf norm distance
% of the approximate leverage scores is smaller than this, convergence
% has been achieved
%
% maxiters is the maximum number of iterations to use
%
% returns the approximate leverage scores and the number of iterations
% needed
