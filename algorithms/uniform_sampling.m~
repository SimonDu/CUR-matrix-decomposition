function out = uniform_sampling(in)
% out = simple_Nystrom(in)
%
% in is a structure with (at least) the following fields:
% - A, a matrix
% - k, the target rank of the approximation
% - p, the rank of first two partition matrix
% - number_of_c_and_r, a two row matrix specifying the numbers of column and rows 
%   samples to use   
% - q, the number of times to repeat each Nystrom method for each number of
%  column samples
%
% out is a structure with the following fields:
%  - cidx, index vector of selected columns
%  - ridx, index vector of selected rows
%  - specerr, froerr, trerr: each matrices with two rows representing 
%  the spectral, frobenius, 
%  and trace norms of the errors in using q realizations of the simple 
%  column-based (sampled uniformly at random w/o replacement)
%  Nystrom extension to A, using l columns. The first row corresponds to 
%  Nystrom extensions where the rank was not fixed, the second to Nystrom
%  extensions where the rank was fixed
% 
%  -timings, a two row matrix of the time it took to run each experiment 
% (i.e. form C, Winv, Wkinv), including the time to approximate the leverage scores

% % if testing
